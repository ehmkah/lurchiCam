# lurchiCam
watching firesalamanders using a smartphone Galaxy S III Mini, Android 4.1.2

The aim is to shoot pictures with the smartphone initialiated by a noise input over the mic.

Proof of concept (POC):
Each ten zehn seconds, the smartphone listens to a noise above a threshold. In case a noise is recognized, a picture will be taken. The pictures can be found here: /Pictures/LurchiCam

The POC is still very buggy..


Usage:
* start the app
* press REC => starts the listening loop with mic (best use by headset) and runs in background.
* press STO => stop the listening loop
* every 10 sec, the loudest noise will be checked. Say someting then..
